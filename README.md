# google-scholar-scraper
This repository hosts codes related to scraping Google Scholar for various informative or interesting data.

## About
One of the key functions of this repo is to produce data from plots of citation counts over time for a given keyword search on Google Scholar. For example, if you would like to gather citation data over the last 20 years for papers on convolutional neural networks, you could enter in your desired keyword to search ("convolutional neural networks"), the path where you would like the .csv file to be saved, as well as the start year (2000), and end year (2020), and out you would get a Pandas dataframe containing the publication counts on that topic for all of the years desired.
